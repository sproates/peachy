This project is an interpreter for a programming language called Peachy.

Design goals of the Peachy language:

- Everything is an object (a la Ruby etc.)
- Support XML as a language construct (a la Scala)
- Support JSON as a language construct (a la JavaScript)
- First class functions
- Strong typing
- Type inference

Features of the interpreter:

- Single threaded
- Stack based
- No external dependencies
- Lexer and parser written from scratch as a learning exercise (i.e. no lex or yacc)
- Test suite
- Good (whatever that might mean) documentation

Out of scope:

- Performance
