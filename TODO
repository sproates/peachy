- Makefile is currently hand rolled and only tested with mingw. Switch to autoconf and automake to make the build system generic.

- Operators need to be restricted to a set. Lexer needs to check for both the start of an operator and whether an entire operator sequence is valid.

- Strings...

- Parser!

- Complete logger

- TokenFactory so token's logger can be injected from outside
