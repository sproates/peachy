This project is an interpreter for a programming language called Peachy.

Design goals of the language:

- Everything is an object
- Everything is a function
- Support XML as a language construct
- Support JSON as a language construct
- Strong typing + type inference

Goals of the interpreter implementation:

- Learn a few things in the process
- Lexer and parser written from scratch
- Single threaded
- Stack based
- No external dependencies if possible
- Test suite
- Documentation
